#  A Game Of Hangs  
Hangman game with a Game of Thrones theme. Click enter to begin the game. Input letters until you solve the puzzle. When you solve it, it tracks your wins. Also, tracks your losses if you don't solve the puzzle in less than 10 guesses. Game is not fully functional due to me being a noob at jQuery at the time.

## Motivation

Created during Week 3 of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to create a hangman game.
